Let's get started creating the minimum template required to work with Bootstrap. In the last video, I showed you the different options for installing bootstrap. We're going to use the option where we download the files that we need locally.

In addition to downloading bootstrap, you need to get two additional libraries to make things work properly. Bootstrap requires that you install a copy of jQuery. jQuery is a library that makes it easier and more consistent to work with JavaScript. You can get a copy of jQuery at this URL.

In order for certain components to work properly, you're going to need to download and install a copy of a library called popper. You can get more information about and download that library at this URL.

As I mentioned, I already downloaded all of the files for you and placed them in the exercises for this course.
